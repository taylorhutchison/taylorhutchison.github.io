# Starting a new project

I have been looking for a new programming outlet for about a year now. I wanted to dive into desktop app development, but the only credible contender, Windows Presentation Foundation seems to be at a cross-roads, and until that solid cross-platform strategy emerges I'll just put that learning path on hold.

I'm really looking for something different than web application development. I feel that I need something different enough to help me triangulate my world-view as it pertains to software development. I think that the mobile app development domain is a great place to look. Mobile app development presents many new ways to think about user experience and software architectures.

## My plan

I'd like to make some grand commitment to learning mobile app development for a year and say I'll make a blog post everyday to record my journey. However, I know that I most likely won't be able to do that. I'm going to start with one month (July 2017) of dedicated learning about iOS and Swift. I'll reassess at the end of the month. Every day I train I'll try to make a blog post highlighting what I have learned.

Wish me luck!
