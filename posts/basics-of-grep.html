        <h4>
            The Command Line
        </h4>

        <p>
            When I was first learning programming I intentionally stayed away from the command line. I could go to the
            command prompt when necessary, but quickly escaped back to the comfort of the GUI tools. It took me a long
            time to see the value of the command line, and now the CLI is an essential part of my workflow.
        </p>

        <p>
            The hardest part of becoming comfortable with the CLI was remembering all the commands. I am a spatial
            thinker. It is easy for me to remember the location of buttons and menus to click. Remembering the names and
            options of commands took training and practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first Unix tool I remember using (beyond simple directory exploration) that was my real "ah-ha" moment
            was grep. I want to show a couple of examples about how it can be useful for every searching situations.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Finding matching files
        </h4>

        <p>
            The ls command lists all files and directories in your current directory or a provided directory. The output
            of the ls command can be piped (with the &#124; symbol) to the grep command to perform some searching of the
            results.
        </p>

        <p>
            So lets imagine a scenario where you have a directory full of log files. These log files are generated when
            an application that is running on your machine encounters errors. When the log files are generated they have
            a filename covention of ERROR-YYYY-MM-DD-SEQUENCE.log. Let us further imagine this application has been
            running for years and there are thousands of files.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you wanted to find all the log files in a directory that match a certain signature, say for instance all
            the files from September of 2016 you could do this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="bash">ls | grep "2016-09"</code></pre>

        <p>
            This is incredibly useful for searching directories with lots of files, but the real power of grep can be
            seen when we use it search the contents of files.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Grep options
        </h4>

        <p>
            Like most other Unix commands, grep can take options. There are several options but three that I always use:
            --recursive (search all the files in all the directories below where I say to start), --ignore-case
            (searching for "Unix" will match both "unix" and "UNIX"), and --line-number (display the line number of the
            files where matches are found). Thats a lot of characters to type so I use the short form of each: -r, -i,
            -n and further combine them as -rin. So every time I use grep for searching through the contents of files I
            instincively type "grep -rin".
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that the options are out of the way the next parameter is the text to search for. The search pattern can
            use Unix regular-expressions, but lets call that an advanced feature and demonstrate something simple. If I
            wanted to search all the files and files in subfolders (remember the --recursive or -r option) for the
            string "security" then I could do this:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="bash">grep -rin security .</code></pre>

        <p>
            The final period character at the end of the command tells grep to start searching in the current working
            directory. I could have just as easily told it to search elsewhere using something like this:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="bash">grep -rin security ~/Documents</code></pre>

        <p>
            If the pattern you are searching for contains spaces or other special characters you can surround your
            search string in double quotes like this:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="bash">grep -rin "network security" ~/Documents</code></pre>

        <h5>
            Excluding directories from grep
        </h5>

        <p>
            Finally I want to show you how to exclude directories from the recursive searching. This can be very useful
            if there is a lot of nested directories (for instance NodeJS developers and the node_modules folder.)
        </p>

        <p>
            The --exclude-dir= option (there is no short-form) takes a <a
                href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html">glob pattern</a>
            and leaves the matching directories out of the search. Therefore:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="bash">grep -rin --exclude-dir=node_modules index .</code></pre>

        <p>
            This would search the current directory recursively for the pattern "index", but exclude the node_modules
            folder. If you have multiple directories you would like to exclude you can wrap the pattern in curly braces
            and comma-seperate the glob patterns, making sure to not leave spaces between the patterns, for instance:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="bash">grep -rin --exclude-dir={node_modules,dist} index .</code></pre>

        <h4>
            Conclusion
        </h4>

        <p>
            I hope you were able to learn something new by reading this. It took me a long time to feel comfortable at
            the command line, and feel confident that I was not going to destroy my system by issuing the wrong command.
            My advice is to practice these commands and other simple commands (which I will cover in another post) and
            grow incrementally.
