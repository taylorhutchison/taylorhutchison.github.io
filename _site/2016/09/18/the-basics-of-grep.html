            <h3 id="the-command-line">The Command Line</h3>

<p>When I was first learning programming I intentionally stayed away from the command line. I could go to the command prompt when necessary, but quickly escaped back to the comfort of the GUI tools. It took me a long time to see the value of the command line, and now the CLI is an essential part of my workflow.</p>

<p>The hardest part of becoming comfortable with the CLI was remembering all the commands. I am a spatial thinker. It is easy for me to remember the location of buttons and menus to click. Remembering the names and options of commands took training and practice.</p>

<p>The first Unix tool I remember using (beyond simple directory exploration) that was my real “ah-ha” moment was grep. I want to show a couple of examples about how it can be useful for every searching situations.</p>

<h3 id="finding-matching-files">Finding matching files</h3>

<p>The ls command lists all files and directories in your current directory or a provided directory. The output of the ls command can be piped (with the | symbol) to the grep command to perform some searching of the results.</p>

<p>So lets imagine a scenario where you have a directory full of log files. These log files are generated when an application that is running on your machine encounters errors. When the log files are generated they have a filename covention of ERROR-YYYY-MM-DD-SEQUENCE.log. Let us further imagine this application has been running for years and there are thousands of files.</p>

<p>If you wanted to find all the log files in a directory that match a certain signature, say for instance all the files from September of 2016 you could do this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">ls</span> | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="s2">"2016-09"</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>This is incredibly useful for searching directories with lots of files, but the real power of grep can be seen when we use it search the contents of files.</p>

<h3 id="grep-options">Grep options</h3>

<p>Like most other Unix commands, grep can take options. There are several options but three that I always use: –recursive (search all the files in all the directories below where I say to start), –ignore-case (searching for “Unix” will match both “unix” and “UNIX”), and –line-number (display the line number of the files where matches are found). Thats a lot of characters to type so I use the short form of each: -r, -i, -n and further combine them as -rin. So every time I use grep for searching through the contents of files I instincively type “grep -rin”.</p>

<p>Now that the options are out of the way the next parameter is the text to search for. The search pattern can use Unix regular-expressions, but lets call that an advanced feature and demonstrate something simple. If I wanted to search all the files and files in subfolders (remember the –recursive or -r option) for the string “security” then I could do this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-rin</span> security .</code></pre></figure>

<p>The final period character at the end of the command tells grep to start searching in the current working directory. I could have just as easily told it to search elsewhere using something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-rin</span> security ~/Documents</code></pre></figure>

<p>If the pattern you are searching for contains spaces or other special characters you can surround your search string in double quotes like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-rin</span> <span class="s2">"network security"</span> ~/Documents</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="excluding-directories-from-grep">Excluding directories from grep</h4>

<p>Finally I want to show you how to exclude directories from the recursive searching. This can be very useful if there is a lot of nested directories (for instance NodeJS developers and the node_modules folder.)</p>

<p>The –exclude-dir= option (there is no short-form) takes a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html">glob pattern</a>
and leaves the matching directories out of the search. Therefore:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-rin</span> <span class="nt">--exclude-dir</span><span class="o">=</span>node_modules index. </code></pre></figure>

<p>This would search the current directory recursively for the pattern “index”, but exclude the node_modules folder. If you have multiple directories you would like to exclude you can wrap the pattern in curly braces and comma-seperate the glob patterns, making sure to not leave spaces between the patterns, for instance:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-rin</span> <span class="nt">--exclude-dir</span><span class="o">={</span>node_modules,dist<span class="o">}</span> index <span class="nb">.</span> </code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I hope you were able to learn something new by reading this. It took me a long time to feel comfortable at the command line, and feel confident that I was not going to destroy my system by issuing the wrong command. My advice is to practice these commands and other simple commands (which I will cover in another post) and grow incrementally.</p>

<p>Cheers
Taylor Hutchison</p>
